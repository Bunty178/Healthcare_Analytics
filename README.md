### This project aims to predict heart disease using neural networks. By analyzing attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and other characteristics, patients will be classified based on the severity of coronary artery disease. The dataset, which includes information on 303 patients, is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Machine learning and artificial intelligence are poised to revolutionize the healthcare field. Therefore, gaining proficiency in data processing techniques for numerical health data and familiarizing yourself with popular classification algorithms is incredibly valuable. This tutorial will guide you through these processes.

### We will utilize several common Python libraries, including pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. For the machine learning aspect of the project, we will employ sklearn and keras. Ensure these libraries are installed by importing them using the cell below.
